# Inbound arrivals to Africa

## Motivation

The last 4th of April I was Furloughed from my job at British Airways. At that point in time I tried to look out for opportunities to improve my skillset and to help others. I think "Furlough time" is a good time to both reflect on your future objectives and to help others whilst taking care of your wellbeing as much as possible. 
It happens to me that one of my flatmates works for an important British touroperator which main market is Africa, and I was curious about the African continent, hence wanted to discover more about it! All in all, my main objectives were to increase my knowledge about Africa and help my friend to understand the market share and the trend of arrivals by country at the borders of a set of African countries. 
<br>
I needed data, so I started looking out on the internet for tourism data for African countries and I found the World Tourism Organization webapage and in particular the Tourism statistics by Economic Group: UNECA with country specific data on arrivals, basic indicators and Outbound tourism from where I was able to extract the data from Excel files with tables set in a compact form.
<br>
I then used my Excel and R skills to dig more into the R Shiny world, below you can find the steps that were taken in a more detailed way.

## The Process

To carry out this app about the inbound arrivals to a set of African countries I have spend a loooot of time learning,
implementing and improving my R and RStudio skills. From using the dplyr, spData, raster, leaflet, tmap, ggplot3 and plotly R packages
to build consistent maps and plots, with its respectives data frame to dealing with HTML, CSS and Boostrap to get a 
good looking App. I hope you enjoy it!

Regarding the main goal of this site, when I built it I mainly wanted get to know the distribution 
of the African continent and get a clearer sense of where each Country were and how was the continent distributed in terms of land cover.

I also aimed to analyse the origen countries of the arrivals at the borders of four countries in particular: Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Namibia for the period covering from 2013 to 2018.

Last but not least, I tought it would be interesting to look at the evolution of arrivals through the period analysed. To achieve this, I built interactive views showing the trend by Continent, Region and Country/Subregion.
